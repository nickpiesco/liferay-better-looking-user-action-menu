# Building a Better-Looking Action Menu in Liferay 6.1

The Dockbar provides one-stop shopping for your Portal administration needs; but sometimes you either don't like the default look of it (if you're building from `_styled`) or you don't feel like styling it from scratch (if you're building from `_unstyled`). You can provide links outside the Dockbar; but they're not all created the same way, and Liferay has moved the goalposts a bit between 6.0 and 6.1. We're going to build a menu with the following actions:

* Add Portlet
* Change Layout Template
* Toggle Edit Controls
* Edit User Profile
* Open Control Panel
* Sign In/Sign Out
